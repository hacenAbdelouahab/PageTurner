    description: `No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving - every day. 
    James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on 
    habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, 
    and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.

    If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because 
    you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. 
    You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.

    Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the
    most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good 
    habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, listeners will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.`,

    description: ` "Rich Dad Poor Dad" is a personal finance book written by Robert Kiyosaki. 
    The book tells the story of Kiyosaki's childhood, where he had two influential 
    figures in his life: his real father (the "poor dad") and his best friend's father (the "rich dad").
     Through the contrasting lessons and perspectives of these two individuals, 
     Kiyosaki imparts valuable financial wisdom and highlights the differences in mindset and approach to money. 
     The book emphasizes the importance of financial education, asset acquisition, and building passive income streams 
     to achieve financial independence. Kiyosaki challenges conventional beliefs about money and encourages readers to develop a 
     mindset that prioritizes financial literacy and the creation of wealth. "Rich Dad Poor Dad" serves as a 
     motivational and educational tool to inspire
     individuals to take control of their financial future and think outside the traditional employment paradigm.

    description: ` Think and Grow Rich has been called the "Granddaddy of All Motivational Literature." It was the first book to boldly ask, "What makes a winner?" The man who asked and listened for the answer, Napoleon Hill, is now counted in the top ranks of the world's winners himself.
    The most famous of all teachers of success spent "a fortune and the better part of a lifetime of effort" 
    to produce the "Law of Success" philosophy that forms the basis of his books and that is so powerfully summarized in this one.
    
    In the original Think and Grow Rich, published in 1937, Hill draws on stories of Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, 
    and other millionaires of his generation to illustrate his principles. In the updated version, Arthur R. Pell, Ph.D., a nationally known author, lecturer, and consultant in human resources management and an expert in applying Hill's thought, deftly interweaves anecdotes of how contemporary millionaires and billionaires, such as Bill Gates, Mary Kay Ash, Dave Thomas, and Sir John Templeton, achieved their wealth. Outmoded or 
    arcane terminology and examples are faithfully refreshed to preclude any stumbling blocks to a new generation of readers. `,

    . She’s come a long way from the small town where she grew up—she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. And when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life seems too good to be true.

    Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily.
     And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.
    
    As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan—her first love and a link to the past she left behind.
     He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.
    
    An honest, evocative, and tender novel, It Ends with Us is “a glorious and touching read, a forever keeper. The kind of book that 
    gets handed down” (USA TODAY). `,

    description: ` Atelier education is centered on the belief that working in a studio, not sitting in the lecture hall, is the 
    best place to learn about art. Every artist needs to learn basic drawing skills. In this elegant and inspiring workbook, master 
    contemporary artist and best selling author Juliette Aristides breaks down the drawing process into small, manageable lessons; 
    presents them progressively; introduces time-tested principles and techniques in the Atelier tradition that are easily accessible; 
    and shares the language and context necessary to understand the artistic process and create superior, well-crafted drawings. What 
    makes this approach unique is the fact that it includes blank pages for copying and practicing within each lesson, facilitating 
    traditional Atelier methods. Ateliers have produced the greatest artists of all time--and now that educational model is 
    experiencing a renaissance. These studios, in a return to classical art training, are based on the nineteenth-century model of 
    teaching artists by pairing them with a master artist over a period of years. Students begin by copying masterworks, then gradually 
    progress to painting as their skills develop. Beginning Drawing Atelier is like having an atelier in a book - and the master is 
    Juliette Aristides, a classically trained artist. On every page, Aristides uses the works of Old Masters and today's most respected 
    realist artists to demonstrate and teach the principles of realist drawing and painting, taking students step by step through the 
    learning curve yet allowing them to work at their own pace. Unique and inspiring, the approach in this new book offers serious art
    courses for serious art
    students. `,
